Praying for everyone in Toronto this might be an L you can’t recover from.
 -------------------------------- 
#Warriors barely survive. Can they pull it level in game 6? I doubt it.
 -------------------------------- 
Somewhere, I know @AlexJMercurio is saying "That's playoff Lowry for ya"
 -------------------------------- 
How does Kawhi not take that last shot!!?? He should want that shot. You only need two points. Don’t throw up a three. Smh 🤮 @NBA
 -------------------------------- 
This the greatest clip of all time
 -------------------------------- 
Boogie shot violation, an over and back, and a moving screen. And Toronto still couldn't close the door. Unreal. #NBAFinals
