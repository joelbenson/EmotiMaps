And I can't even IMAGINE how Toronto and the rest of Canada feels right now. So. Close.
 -------------------------------- 
as much as I wanted toronto to win the refs were blowing the whistle waay too much. let them play

Lowry could have sent two countries into an uproar but he knocked out a popcorn vendor 😴
 -------------------------------- 
Worst. Timeout. Ever. Why Nick Nurse. Kawhi was rolling. Bizarre.
